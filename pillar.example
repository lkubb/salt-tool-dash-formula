# The different sources will be merged. For further information,

# Apart from the various source files, there are two independent source trees
# for user-specific configuration.
# Generally tool_dash > tool_global.
# `tool_global` focuses on specific users, of which most values
# will be respected by all formulae in the `tool` suite:
tool_global:
  users:

      # The following is global configuration for the user named `user`.
    user:

        # Persist environment variables used by this formula for this
        # user to this file (will be appended to a file relative to $HOME)
      persistenv: '.config/zsh/zshenv'

        # Add runcom hooks specific to this formula to this file
        # for this user (will be appended to a file relative to $HOME)
      rchook: '.config/zsh/zshrc'

        # This user's configuration for this formula. Will be overridden by
        # user-specific configuration in `tool_dash:users`.
        # Set this to `false` to disable configuration for this user.
      dash:
        license: dash-license-text

tool_dash:

    # Default formula configuration for all users.
  defaults:
    license: default value for all users

    # User configuration can also be specified here in
    # `tool_dash:users`. It will override
    # configuration sourced from `tool_global:users`.
  users:
    user:
      persistenv: '.bash_profile'
      dash:
        license: this overrides config from tool_globl:users
